# Talent Match AI

## Overview
Talent Match AI helps companies hire exceptional talent using AI-based semantic matching instead of keyword filtering.

## Problem
Traditional hiring systems fail to understand meaning and context in resumes and job descriptions.

## Solution
This project builds an AI system that:
- Represents jobs and candidates as vectors
- Computes semantic similarity
- Explains why a candidate is a good match

## Roadmap
Week 1: Problem framing and data  
Week 2: Data representation  
Week 3: Baseline NLP matching  
Week 4: Transformer embeddings  

## Status
Week 1 in progress.
